Beginner Portfolio using MySQL 

Welcome to my SQL project portfolio! This repository showcases my skills and expertise in SQL database management and querying. In this project, I have created a simple bookstore database and implemented various SQL operations to interact with the data.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of SQL concepts and techniques through the creation of a functional bookstore database. The database includes tables for books, authors, and more, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of information.
