Beginner Portfolio using MySQL 

Welcome to my SQL project portfolio! This repository showcases my skills and expertise in SQL database management and querying. In this project, I have created a simple bookstore database and implemented various SQL operations to interact with the data.

Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of SQL concepts and techniques through the creation of a functional bookstore database. The database includes tables for books, authors, and more, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of information.

2. Ensure that you have MySQL installed on your system and have a MySQL server up and running.<br>
3. Create a new MySQL database (e.g., "bookstore") and execute the provided SQL scripts to set up the necessary tables and populate them with sample data. The scripts can be found in the "SQL scripts" folder.<br>
4. Modify the database connection details in the SQL scripts or any other configuration files as needed to match your local environment.<br>
